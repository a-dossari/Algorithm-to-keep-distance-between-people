# Anti Coronavirus Algorithm 

An algorithm that keeps people far enough (two meters) from each other, to reduce the spread of Coronavirus. I used a flowchart and mentioned the technique and how it will work. This algorithm is similar to a mobile app called taba'ud (in Arabic: تباعد), it use Bluetooth to determine the number of persons and the distance between each other, and it send to you a message in case if you contacted with person infected with the Coronavirus.
